    <h1>Bakeries-R-Us</h1>
    <p>Bakeries-R-Us has given you an irresistible offer. They want you as their new CEO. Why you? Well, you're not
    sure, since you can't bake, but you shouldn't let a good opportunity go. In fact, they assure you that there
    will be no baking involved. All you have to do is ensure the bakery has enough ingredients to sell enough bread
    to make a profit.</p>

    <p>Do you accept the challenge of becoming CEO? You will have to within a year turn a budget of one million
    dollars into a handsome profit. If you do, you will get a big bonus. If you don't, you will be demoted to 
    unemployed</p>
