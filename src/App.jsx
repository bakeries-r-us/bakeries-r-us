    <h1>Bakeries-R-Us</h1>
    <p>Bakeries-R-Us has given you an irresistible offer. They want you as their new CEO. Why you? Well, you're not
        sure, since you can't bake, but you shouldn't let a good opportunity go. In fact, they assure you that there
        will be no baking involved. All you have to do is ensure the bakery has enough ingredients to sell enough bread
        to make a profit.</p>

    <p>Do you accept the challenge of becoming CEO? You will have to within a year turn a budget of one million
        dollars into a handsome profit. If you do, you will get a big bonus. If you don't, you will be demoted to
        unemployed.</p>
